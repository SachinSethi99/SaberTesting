# ðŸ“° BBC Article Scraper

## Description

This project consists of two main components:

1. **Python Scraper**: A script that scrapes article headlines and URLs from the BBC website and stores them in a PostgreSQL database.
2. **Next.js Frontend**: A web application that displays the scraped articles and allows users to delete articles from the database.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL

## Setup

### PostgreSQL Database

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 psycopg2-binary aiohttp tqdm

## Run the Scraper
Navigate to the bbc-scraper-frontend directory and run the scraper script to populate the database:
cd bbc-scraper-frontend
python scraper.py
