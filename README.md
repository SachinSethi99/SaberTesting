# 📰 BBC Article Scraper

## Description

This project consists of two main components:

1. **Python Scraper**: A script that scrapes article headlines and URLs from the BBC website and stores them in a PostgreSQL database.
2. **Next.js Frontend**: A web application that displays the scraped articles and allows users to delete articles from the database.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL

## Setup

### PostgreSQL Database

Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Create a new database for this project.
